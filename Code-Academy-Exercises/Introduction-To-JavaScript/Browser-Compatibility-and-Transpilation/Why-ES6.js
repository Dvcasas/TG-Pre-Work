var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = "You can make carbonara with " + pasta + ", " + meat + ", " + " and a sauce made with " + sauce + ".";

/* This example demonstrates how new features of ES6 cannot run in older
browsers that are not updated to the new standard. To fix the issue, we use a
method to provide the smae result using the older syntax. This will run in
older and updated browsers.

ES6 updates bring a lot of streamlined features to the language including the
more consistent writing style used in other OOP languages, certain syntax
changes which will help prevent common pittfalls developers may run into and
overall concise and cleaner way to write code. */
