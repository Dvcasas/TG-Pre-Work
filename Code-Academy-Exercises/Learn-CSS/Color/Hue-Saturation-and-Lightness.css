/* HSL or hue, saturation and lightness has a similar syntax to RGB but the
last two values are percentages. (hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)) The first
number for hue is a number between 0 and 360 and represents a color degree on
the color spectrum wheel. The saturation refers to the color intensity and
determines where in the radius the color is. 100% being the most intense.
Lightness refers to how light or dark the color should appear. 50% is the normal
value and moving the percentage up towards 100% makes it lighter where going
down makes it darker. */
